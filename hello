The conservation of a natural ecosystem implies proposing non-invasive technological solutions to analyze and detect the health of its species. 
For this, animal identification based on acoustic parameters is a considerable advantage, such as less time, less cost and harmless to the habitat [1]. 
Acoustic data processing can be done manually by an expert; however, it is a procedure that requires a great deal of time and effort to process even small volumes of data [2].
Consequently, for the analysis of the audio information, automatic methodologies capable of detecting and identifying species in the records are required [3â€“7]. 

Therefore, ecoacoustics is considered as an efficient alternative that enables the analysis of an ecosystem through the processing of multiple recordings that, 
when analyzed with artificial intelligence techniques, it is possible to identify changes in the environment. 
Here, we propose this software based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence algorithm and which is constituted as a practical tool for monitoring an ecosystem and automatic recognition of species [8]. 
Additionally, the software allows the analysis of a large amount of data from recordings that contribute to the knowledge of the state of biodiversity. 
The functionality of this software means that any researcher can quickly classified sounds for geophony, biophony or anthropophony identification studies. 
The free/open-source software for automatic species recognition based on unsupervised algorithms also means that anybody can use/modify the software for fit their research needs.
